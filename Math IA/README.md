# Math IA

This is a paper I wrote my senior year of high school that investigated what stats are most highly correlated with runs scored.

## Issues with the paper
I wish I used expected stats from Baseball Savant, but in order to minimize problems with datasets, I simply downloaded the [2019 Team Standard Batting Table](https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/majors/2019.shtml) from Baseball-Reference as a `CSV` file for use in Excel. 

If I were to do this again I would import way more (predictive/expected) statistics and do more research into outliers, that I couldn't do previously with word count limitations.
